I am a highly motivated fifth-year computer science undergraduate at **Sharif University of Technology, Iran** with a strong passion for learning and research. My primary research interests lie in **computer systems**, **verification**, and **programming languages**. I am currently looking for **PhD positions for Fall 2025**.

<br>
My journey in computer science began during high school, where I discovered my love for programming and algorithms. I competed in the National Olympiad in Informatics, earning a silver medal.

<br>
During my university years, I attended a software engineering bootcamp, which sparked my fascination with programming languages. As I gained more experience, I delved into computer systems and verification, finding these areas particularly interesting due to their critical role in the foundations of many real-world, mission-critical software projects.

Here is a list of my previous works and experiences:

- I worked as a Software Engineer at Hermes Capital for one year, where I tackled a variety of software engineering challenges and gained valuable hands-on experience in the field.

- In Summer 2023, I joined [Dr. Parreaux](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~parreaux/)'s research group at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) as a research intern. During this internship, I contributed to the design and implementation of several features for the MLscript language.

- In Summer 2024, I started a research project with [Dr. Kallas](https://angelhof.github.io/programmable-software-systems-lab.html) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), focusing on finding optimization solutions for serverless computing platforms.
